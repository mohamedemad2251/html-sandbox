    <!-- We already know that stuff. But just so you know there's inline styling (when writing 
     style attribute, ex: style="color: blue;"), there's internal styling (when you write the 
     <style> element in the <head>) and there's external styling (the right way) where you have a 
      seperate file somewhere and you link it using <link rel="spreadsheet" href="directory"/> -->
