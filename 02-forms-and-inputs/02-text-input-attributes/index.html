    <!-- Placeholder: That greyed out text that gives the user an example of what to type (check email) -->
    <!-- Value: Default value for a field -->
    <!-- Required: Make a field required to be populated -->
    <!-- Disabled: A field is greyed out completely and can't be populated (Read-Only) -->
    <!-- Name: This isn't the name of the field, but the variable you can use on server-side to manipulate
    the data you just got. Example: name=email, when using the data, you'll use "email" -->
    <!-- NOTE: Don't use method="GET" for secured information/inputs in the form -->
    <!-- Forms have a "GET" method by default. "GET" are only used if you're searching for something -->
    <!-- Use POST with forms -->
