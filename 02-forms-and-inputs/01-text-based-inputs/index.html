    <h1>HTML & CSS Sandbox - Text Inputs</h1>
    <!-- A form tag is for showing the input fields you can type into, it doesn't do anything on the
     server side. But it's how the form is structured & displayed using HTML & CSS -->
    <!-- Have a form tag to enclose anything that is form related. Action represents the server-side
     action that occurs when you submit this form (to process the data) -->
    <!-- Now this is very important: methods can be POST & GET (HTTP protocol). POST is for sending
      data from the client to server and GET is from server to client -->
    <!-- HTTP is a hypertext protocol to send/recieve HTML (not sure if it's that only).
       You can have POST, GET, DELETE, etc. (you can search up the resst) -->
    <!-- <form action="#" method="POST"> -->
    <form method="POST">
      <!-- A label tag is to have the label represented in your browser, without it, only the textbox
       shows -->
      <div>
        <!-- The "for" attribute is to connect a label to the id of an input (remember, the ID) -->
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <!-- Input tag is the actual textbox you can type into, it's how you send the data -->
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
      </div>

      <!-- Line break element, but not the best way to do this, use CSS instead (we're making it easy
       here) -->
